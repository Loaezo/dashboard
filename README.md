# Business dashboard 

This application was creates as a project for Platzi Master, to help improve the knowledge and skills that are needed in the tech industry. It is meant to be a way of comparing your company's market value against other similar companies.

You are required to manually enter your company's name, description, number of shares it has and the value per share. It will then graphically show you how it is positioned and compare its value against other companies, using the information provided.

It was created using Django because it is intented to develop the tech skills needed in the frontend and the backend to create a simple app. It uses the template system that comes with Django as well as SQLite, the database included with this framework. No extra libraries are needed, it is pure HTML and Django.

@loaezo and @oscaremc contributed to this project the former in the backend and the latter in the frontend. It still needs to be completed, the connection to the database has not been established yet and the values displayed are randomly generated.

To install it, you only need to start a virtual environment in python and activate it. Inside, install Django 3.2 and clone the repository. After the successfull cloning of the project, start the local server using "python manage.py runserver" command in the CLI and it will start a local server in the "127.0.0.1:8000" IP.
